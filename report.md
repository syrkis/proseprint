# Abstract

Authorship attribution is a well-studied problem in the field of Natural Language Processing. However, most of the work in this area has focused on single-author writing style analysis. In this paper, we present a novel approach to multi-author writing style analysis. We use a combination of word frequency and word2vec to create a vector representation of each author's writing style. We then use a Support Vector Machine to classify the author of a given text. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 10 authors, and achieve an accuracy of 0.8.
