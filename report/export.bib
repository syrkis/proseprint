   abstract = {Tree boosting is a highly effective and widely used machine learning method. In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quan-tile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},

   abstract = {We present a siamese adaptation of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for labeled data comprised of pairs of variable-length sequences. Our model is applied to assess semantic similarity between sentences, where we exceed state of the art, outperforming carefully handcrafted features and recently proposed neural network systems of greater complexity. For these applications, we provide wordembedding vectors supplemented with synonymic information to the LSTMs, which use a fixed size vector to encode the underlying meaning expressed in a sentence (irrespective of the particular wording/syntax). By restricting subsequent operations to rely on a simple Manhattan metric, we compel the sentence representations learned by our model to form a highly structured space whose geometry reflects complex semantic relationships. Our results are the latest in a line of findings that showcase LSTMs as powerful language models capable of tasks requiring intricate understanding.},

   abstract = {Style change detection means to identify positions at which the authorship in a multi-author document changes. Reliably detecting these positions is key for multi-author document analyses, and it is a preliminary step for authorship identification. This year style change detection task at PAN features three connected subtasks: (1) For a text written by two authors, which contains a single style change only, find the position of this change, i.e., cut the text into the two authors' texts on the paragraph-level. (2) For a text written by two or more authors, find all positions of writing style change, i.e., assign all paragraphs of the text uniquely to some author out of the number of authors assumed for the multi-author document. (3) For a text written by two or more authors, find all positions of writing style change. In particular, style changes may occur both between paragraphs but also at sentence level. The task is evaluated on a dataset compiled from an English Q&A platform. The paper in hand introduces the style change detection task, the underlying dataset, the approaches employed by the participants, and the achieved results.},

@article{Stamatatos2009,
   abstract = {Authorship attribution supported by statistical or computational methods has a long history starting from the 19th century and is marked by the seminal study of Mosteller and Wallace (1964) on the authorship of the disputed "Federalist Papers." During the last decade, this scientific field has been developed substantially, taking advantage of research advances in areas such as machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing. The plethora of available electronic texts (e.g., e-mail messages, online forum messages, blogs, source code, etc.) indicates a wide variety of applications of this technology, provided it is able to handle short and noisy text from multiple candidate authors. In this article, a survey of recent advances of the automated approaches to attributing authorship is presented, examining their characteristics for both text representation and text classification. The focus of this survey is on computational requirements and settings rather than on linguistic or literary issues. We also discuss evaluation methodologies and criteria for authorship attribution studies and list open questions that will attract future work in this area.},
